    "Number of reviews: 568,454<br>\n",
    "Number of users: 256,059<br>\n",
    "Number of products: 74,258<br>\n",

While coming back from a supply store, the couple suddenly get caught inside of a  &quot;broken-up&quot; bridge and then just before they start to tumble down  into the lake, a board catches them.  But just when they've got their hopes  up, and small dog steps on the board and the car starts to slide off the  bridge and into the lake waters.  A few minutes later...<p>They find  themselves back into their home, they find that somehow somehad light the  fireplace, as if done by magic.  From then on, they find a weird-looking  dead guy known as Bettlejuice.  The only way they can get him for help is  to call him by his name three times and he will appear at their survice.  But they soon wish that they have never called his name, because  Bettlejuice was once a troublemaker but he is the only one who can save  them, on the account that they said his name three times.  They can't leave  their houses or else they will find theirselves in another world with giant  sandworms.  This is a stellar comedy that you should see! Michael Keaton is  awesome as he plays the leading role of Bettlejuice.\n"
